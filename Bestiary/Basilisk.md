**2d10 + 2**

- ✦ ≤11: 5 poison damage
- ★ 12-16: 8 poison damage

**MGT RR**

- ✦ ≤11: Restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** The basilisk targets the first unobstructed creature in each column of the area. Each target magically begins to turn to stone. An already slowed target has a bane on resisting the roll. A creature restrained by this ability or a creature adjacent to them can use an action to cut the encroaching stone from their body, taking 8 damage which can't be reduced in any way and ending the effect.
