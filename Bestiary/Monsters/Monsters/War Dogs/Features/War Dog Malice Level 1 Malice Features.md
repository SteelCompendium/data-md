###### War Dog Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any war dog's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Reconstitute (3 Malice)**
>
> One war dog acting this turn tears apart a nearby corpse of a humanoid and incorporates its body parts into their own. The war dog regains Stamina equal to 5 times their level.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Fire for Effect (5 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Magic, Ranged** |                     **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------------- | -------------------------------: |
> | **📏 4 cube within 10** | **🎯 Each creature in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target makes an **Agility test**. The same condition is imposed on each affected target.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 fire damage; slowed or weakened (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 5 fire damage; slowed or weakened (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 fire damage

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Fodder Run (7 Malice)**
>
> Each war dog minion in the encounter shifts up to their speed and can make a free strike. A minion who does so is then reduced to 0 Stamina.
