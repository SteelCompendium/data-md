###### War Dog Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher war dog's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The war dog activates a Malice feature available to war dogs of level 3 or lower.

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Loyalty Unto Death (5 Malice)**
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |        **Maneuver** |
> | ----------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Two war dogs** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target who has a loyalty collar shifts up to their speed, then is reduced to 0 Stamina. After each target's Loyalty Collar trait is resolved, each enemy adjacent to either target makes a Presence test.
>
> - **≤11:** Push 4; the enemy is frightened of the nearest non-minion war dog (save ends)
> - **12-16:** Push 2; the enemy is frightened of the nearest non-minion war dog (EoT)
> - **17+:** Push 2
