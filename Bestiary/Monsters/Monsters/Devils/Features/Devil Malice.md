###### Devil Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any devil's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bureaucratic Tape (3 Malice)**
>
> One devil acting this turn uses a signature ability against an adjacent creature. On a tier 3 outcome, the target of the ability has a double bane on strikes (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Underhanded Tactics (5+ Malice)**
>
> One or two devils can teleport to a space adjacent to one or more creatures who aren't hidden and make a free strike. For each 2 additional Malice spent on this feature, one additional devil can teleport.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Read the Small Print (7 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter is subject to a bad deal proposed by the devils. An enemy must choose between having damage weakness 5 or taking a bane on power rolls. The bad deal lasts until the end of the encounter.
