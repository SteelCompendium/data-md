      <p>Most of the information presented in a creature's stat

      player characters. However, a few differences are worth
      noting. <em>(Playtest note: Right now, creatures are color
      coded, but this won't be the only way we indicate different

      <section id="languages" class="level3">
        <h3>LANGUAGES</h3>
        <p>If a creature knows at least one language, their stat
        block has a Languages entry that shows the languages they
        know.Creatures who don't know any languages don't have this
        entry.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="keywords" class="level3">
        <h3>KEYWORDS</h3>
        <p>Each creature has one or more keywords. These keywords
        don't necessarily mean anything on their own, but special
        rulesmight apply to them. For instance, a creature with the
        Goblin keyword benefits from and can contribute to goblin
        VillainPower abilities (see below).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="encounter-value" class="level3">
        <h3>ENCOUNTER VALUE</h3>
        <p>Each Director-controlled creature has an encounter value

        SeeEncounter Building for more information.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="creature-free-strikes" class="level3">
        <h3>CREATURE FREE STRIKES</h3>
        <p>When a Director-controlled creature makes a free
        strike,they don't roll. Instead, their stat block features
        a Free Strike stat representing the amount of damage they
        deal with a melee free strike with a distance of reach 1 or
        the creature's signature action, whichever is higher. This
        is also the amount of damage they deal with a ranged free
        strike with a distance equal to 5 or the range of the
        creature's signature action, whichever is higher. Unless
        otherwise noted, a free strike in a trait is a weapon
        attack. Creature free strikes are a static number for two
        reasons. First, it keeps gameplay fast.You don't have to
        stop play to roll dice, and there's no chance of a creature
        rolling a critical hit and bogging things down further when
        it isn't their turn. Second, by keeping these static values
        relatively low, heroes are encouraged to take more risks
        when it really counts, even if that might result in them
        taking damage from a free strike.</p>

          <h4>CREATURE OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS</h4>
          <p>Even though a Director-controlled creature doesn't
          have to roll when they make a free strike, if they have a
          bane onattacks against a creature, they still can't make
          an opportunity attack against them.</p>

        <p>Certain creatures have the ability to take damage in

      <section id="villain-actions" class="level3">
        <h3>VILLAIN ACTIONS</h3>
        <p>The solo and boss creatures presented in this book are
        designed to be fought in climactic battles at the end of an
        adventure or campaign. Because of this, they get special
        abilities called villain actions.</p>
        <p>A creature with villain actions always has three. Each
        villain action can be used only once per encounter, and no
        more than one villain action can be used per round. A
        creature can use a villain action at the end of any other
        creature's turn during combat. Villain actions are numbered
        and intended to be used in a specific order that creates a
        logicalencounter flow and cinematic arc, but you can use
        them in any order you choose.</p>
        <p>The first villain action is an opener, which shows the
        heroes they're not battling a typical creature. Openers
        generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff
        the boss, debuff the heroes, or move the creature into an
        advantageous position. They're a taste of what's to
        come.</p>
        <p>The second villain action provides crowd control. It
        typically activates after the heroes have had a chance to
        respond once or twice to the villain, move into position,
        and surround the villain. This second action helps the
        villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action
        comes in many flavors, but it's even more powerful than an
        opener.</p>
        <p>The third and final villain action is an ultimate move
        or “ult”—a showstopper that the villain can use to deal a
        devastating blow to the heroes before the end of the
        battle. If you have more than two creatures with villain
        actions in an encounter (which should be a rare, if at all
        occurrence), only one villain action total may be used per
        round.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="resistance-roll-abilities" class="level3">
        <h3>RESISTANCE ROLL ABILITIES</h3>
        <p>Some creature abilities say “[Characteristic
        Abbreviation] RR” instead of providing a dice equation.
        This means that instead of the creature rolling when the
        ability is used, the target of the ability must make a
        resistance roll with the indicated characteristic against
        the ability's effects.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="creature-roles" class="level3">
        <h3>CREATURE ROLES</h3>
        <p>A creature's role describes its function in combat in a
        general sense. Roles are descriptive, and most don't follow
        special rules—they simply help you build encounters and use
        creatures effectively in combat. <em>(Playtest note: A lot

      <h2>MINIONS</h2>
      <p>Minions are weaker enemies who are made to die fast and to
      be threatening in large squads. Minion is a monster role that
      always has another role such as artillery or brute attached
      to it, so you know what the minion does well in addition to
      being a minion. The knowledge of how minions work isn't a
      secret, and shouldn't be kept from the players. Share the
      information in this section with them! They'll have a lot
      more fun battling minions and shaping narrative around taking
      out multiple foes at once if they understand how the rules
      work.</p>
      <section id="organized-as-squads" class="level3">
        <h3>ORGANIZED AS SQUADS</h3>
        <p>Minions with the same name (for instance, “goblin
        sniper”) can be organized into squads. All members of a
        minion squad act together on the same initiative, and can
        make squad attacks (see Squad Action).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="shared-low-stamina" class="level3">
        <h3>SHARED LOW STAMINA</h3>
        <p>Minions have low Stamina and fall quickly in battle.
        They allow heroes to feel extra heroic, since a hero might
        kill several minions at once, depending on those minions'
        level and encounter value!</p>
        <p>Each squad of minions shares a Stamina pool, with
        initial Stamina equal to each individual minion's Stamina
        multiplied by the number of minions in the squad. For
        example, goblin snipers each have Stamina 5, so a squad of
        four snipers has a Stamina pool of 20. Whenever a minion in
        a squad takes damage, the squad's Stamina pool is reduced
        by a number equal to the damage taken.</p>
        <p>Because minion Stamina is tracked as a pool, minions
        can't be winded and can't regain Stamina during a
        battle.</p>
        <section id="dropping-one-minion" class="level4">
          <h4>DROPPING ONE MINION</h4>
          <p>Whenever a minion squad's Stamina pool is reduced by
          an amount equal to an individual minion's Stamina, one
          minion dies or otherwise gets taken out of the fight. If
          a squad of goblin snipers has its Stamina pool reduced to
          15, then the minion who took the damage that reduced the
          pool dies. When the Stamina pool hits 10, 5, and finally
          0, another minion in the squad dies. If multiple minions
          take the damage that results in the pool dropping low
          enough to kill one minion, the creature who dealt the
          damage to the minions decides which of those minions
          dies.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="dropping-multiple-minions" class="level4">
          <h4>DROPPING MULTIPLE MINIONS</h4>
          <p>If a single attack reduces a minion squad's Stamina
          pool by an amount of damage equal to the Stamina of
          multiple minions, multiple minions are taken out by the
          damage. Start with minions who took the damage first. If
          all those minions are eliminated and there is still more
          damage to account for , the minions nearest to the ones
          who were taken out suffer the same fate. For instance, if
          one goblin sniper takes 12 damage from a fury's Brutal
          Slam ability, that sniper dies and another nearby sniper
          also gets taken out. Allow the player to narrate how
          their hero takes out additional minions killed by a
          single attack. Maybe each minion is within striking
          distance of the hero, who makes multiple brutal weapon
          attacks with a single action. Maybe the body of the
          original target is hurled into an unfortunate ally. Maybe
          additional minions affected by a single attack pass out
          from fright! Taking out multiple minions is a chance to
          play up the cinematic part of the game.</p>

        <section id="damaging-multiple-minions" class="level4">
          <h4>DAMAGING MULTIPLE MINIONS</h4>
          <p>Minion squads are particularly susceptible to damage
          dealing area abilities and attacks that target multiple
          creatures, because the minion squad'sStamina pool takes
          damage each time an individual minion takes damage. If
          three goblin minions are hit with a conduit's Lightfall
          ability that deals 4 holy damage to each target in its

          <h4>PREPPING MINION STAMINA POOLS</h4>
          <p>When you're preparing a battle with minions, it helps
          to take a moment and write out the different amounts of
          damage at which a minion squad suffers a loss of one of
          their minions. For instance, a squad of goblin snipers
          loses a minion when they take a total of 5, 10, 15, and
          20 damage. If you do the math before combat starts (or
          take a quick moment to jot it down during a pause in
          combat), it'll help things run smoothly.</p>

        <h3>DIFFERENT MINION STRENGTHS</h3>
        <p>Some minions are stronger than others . This lets you
        create squads of differing numbers of minions to keep the
        heroes on their toes as you build encounters that fit your
        needs. Some minions attack and die in droves, such as the
        lowly pitling demon with Stamina 4. Others might be able to
        absorb the damage of one or two signature actions before
        they drop, such as the radenwight ratagast with Stamina 12.
        Both are level 1 minions, but their EVs are different.
        Fewer ratagasts can and should be used in a battle as
        compared to pitlings, and the heroes will need to use their
        best abilities to kill several of those more powerful
        minions at once.</p>

      <section id="acting-together" class="level3">
        <h3>ACTING TOGETHER</h3>
        <p>When minions act, each minion in the squad must use
        their action in concert. This is because minions have squad
        attacks that require participation from all minions,
        requiring all individual attacks to happen at the same
        time.</p>
        <p>Like all creatures, an individual minion—or all the
        minions in a squad—can elect to take no action on a
        turn.</p>
        <section id="minion-action-economy" class="level4">
          <h4>MINION ACTION ECONOMY</h4>
          <p>Minion turns are meant to be short. On their turn,
          each minion can take only a move action and an action, a
          move action and a maneuver, or two move actions.</p>
          <p>Minions can make opportunity attacks, but they
          typically don't have bespoke triggered actions, keeping
          them easy to run.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="squad-action" class="level4">
          <h4>SQUAD ACTION</h4>
          <p>Each minion has a signature action that is an attack
          ability target ing one creature. When multiple minions in
          a squad use their signature action on a turn, make one
          roll for the whole squad. Each minion must target a
          different creature with their signature action. Many
          minion signature actions benefit from the squad being
          close together, so don't spread them out too far!</p>
          <p>If a squad has minions who don't use their signature
          action, those minions can still contribute to the squad's
          effectiveness. Each such minion can use an action to
          increase the damage to one target of the signature action
          by an amount equal to the minion's free strike value, as
          long as that target is within distance of the minion as
          if the minion were using the action, and the minion has
          line of effect to the target.</p>
          <p>If a minion squad gets a critical hit with their
          signature action, then all the minions who participated
          in using the action can use the action again.</p>

          <p>If you use multiple squads made up of the same type of
          minions in an encounter—for instance, two squads of
          goblin spinecleavers - it's important to make it easy for
          the players to tell the squads apart. You can use
          different miniatures for each squad, or give each squad's
          miniatures an indicator (a colored magnet, ring, sticker,
          and so forth) to help you and your players keep track of
          which minions are part of the same squad as they start
          moving around on the battlefield. Many online virtual

        brilliant strategies. Sometimes they're just powerful
        creatures who bully, inspire, or have some supernatural
        influence that drives other creatures to action. A squad of
        minions can only have one captain, and a creature can't be

          <h4>TRIVIAL ENCOUNTERS</h4>
          <p>Trivial encounters are easier than easy. They present
          no challenge at all for the heroes, who are guaranteed to
          survive the battle with their Stamina mostly, if not
          entirely, untouched. Think 10th-level heroes taking on a
          small band of typical kobolds. There's no way it ends
          well for the kobolds. These encounters can be fun to
          occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups,
          the novelty disappears quickly, so that too many trivial
          encounters can feel like a waste of time.</p>

          their lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures

          respites, or for when you want the heroes to feel like
          superheroes while still overcoming a combat challenge

          the bitter end. Such encounters rarely appear in most
          campaigns, though if the heroes are 8th level or higher,
          they can typically survive such encounters - or have a
          good chance of coming back to life afterward.</p>

        <h3>STEP 2: DETERMINE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY</h3>
        <p>To determine how many creatures and other types of
        challenges you should have in an encounter, you need to
        figure out the heroes' encounter strength (abbreviated
        ES).</p>
        <p>To calculate a group's ES, first determine each hero's
        encounter worth. This starts at a baseline of 12, then you
        add 3 for each level of the hero. For instance, a 3rd-level
        hero has an encounter worth of 21 (12 + 3 + 3 +3). Then add
        the encounter worth of all heroes together, and that's your
        ES. For instance, a group of five 3rd-level heroes has an
        ES of</p>
        <ol start="105" type="1"></ol>
        <section id="factor-in-victories" class="level4">
          <h4>FACTOR IN VICTORIES</h4>
          <p>Victories make heroes more powerful on their way to
          the next level. For each 3 Victories the heroes earn,
          increase the overall ES as if there were another hero in
          the party. For instance, if a party of 3rd-level heroes
          has 3 Victories, increase the ES by 21. If they have 6
          Victories, increase the ES by 42. Be careful that the
          larger ES doesn't lead you to using more creatures than
          recommended in Number of Creatures. It's usually better
          to use higher cost creatures in an encounter rather than
          add lots when increasing ES thanks to Victories.</p>
          <p>Since you can rarely predict the exact order in which
          the heroes will face encounters during an adventure, it
          helps to keep a list of monsters with an EV cost worth
          roughly the encounter worth of one, two, and three heroes
          that make sense for the adventure you're running. You can
          easily drop or swap these creatures into an encounter on
          the fly.</p>

        <h3>STEP 3: DETERMINE ENCOUNTER BUDGET</h3>
        <p>Once you know your ES and have chosen your encounter
        difficulty, you can determine your encounter budget as
        follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trivial encounters</strong> have a budget
          that is anything less than 75 percent of your ES.</li>
          <li><strong>Easy encounters</strong> have a budget of
          between 75 and 90 percent of your ES.</li>
          <li><strong>Standard encounters</strong> have a budget
          that is between 90 and 110 percent of your ES.</li>
          <li><strong>Hard encounters</strong> have a budget of
          between 110 and 125 percent of your ES.</li>
          <li><strong>Extreme encounters</strong> have a budget
          that is greater than 125 percent of your ES.</li>

      <section id="step-4-spend-encounter-budget" class="level3">
        <h3>STEP 4: SPEND ENCOUNTER BUDGET</h3>
        <p>You spend your encounter budget to “buy” hostile
        creatures to take part in your encounter.Each hostile
        creature costs a number of budget points equal to its
        encounter value (EV). When choosing creatures, try to
        choose a variety of roles for a more dynamic combat
        experience.</p>
        <section id="consider-creature-level" class="level4">
          <h4>CONSIDER CREATURE LEVEL</h4>
          <p>To ensure an encounter is challenging but not
          devastating for the players, you want to choose creatures
          whose level is within 2 of the heroes' level. For
          instance, creatures of level 3 through 7 are appropriate
          challenges for a party of 5th -level heroes. If the
          heroes have 6 or more Victories, you can push the upper
          limit to within 3 levels of the heroes.</p>
          <p>This is really the only indicator that level serves in
          encounter building. Everything else relies on EV.</p>

        <section id="number-of-creatures" class="level4">
          <h4>NUMBER OF CREATURES</h4>
          <p>Too many creatures or too many different stat blocks
          in an encounter can create a big cognitive load for you
          and turn exciting encounters into slogs.</p>
          <p>In general, you don't want more than five creatures
          per hero at a time in an encounter.If the encounter has
          more than two creatures per hero, at least half the
          creatures in that encounter should be minions.</p>
          <p>When it comes to number of stat blocks, you generally
          don't want to use more than six different kinds of stat
          blocks in an encounter, though you can probably manage
          more if you're using a lot of simple minion stat blocks.
          If you're just starting out as a Director, keep the
          variety small until you're confident in your ability to
          run a complex combat encounter.</p>

          typically the named villains who the heroes face in the

        <h3>STEP 5: BUILD INITIATIVE GROUPS</h3>
        <p>Once you have your creatures selected, you'll put them
        together in initiative groups, with all creatures in the
        same initiative group acting on the same turn. Though it's
        not a hard and fast rule, you can keep the following
        guideline in mind as you build initiative groups: The total
        EV of an initiative group should be between the encounter
        worth of one to two heroes (see Step 2 above).</p>
        <p>This helps to ensure that each encounter group can hold
        its own against any character in the party without
        overwhelming that character.</p>
        <p>It's okay to have one group with a total EV less than
        that. It's also okay for a group to be worth more than two
        heroes,as long as that group consists of a single creature

          <h4>HOW MANY INITIATIVE GROUPS?</h4>
          <p>In a battle without a solo creature, you generally

          plus or minus two. This gives you a healthy range to play

        demons typically become category 2 demons after consuming a
        single soul, there's no known pattern to how more powerful
        demons evolve. Some category 2 demons evolve to category 3
        after consuming just one soul, while others must devour
        thousands before earning a promotion. The evolution from
        one category to the next can be instant, or it can take
        years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate
        on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic
        evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are
        especially corrupt—or heroic.</p>

          <h4>CATEGORY 1 DEMONS</h4>
          <p>The weakest of demon kind, the following category 1
          demons are included in this book:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pitlings</strong> resemble rodents or
            insects, but possess gleaming green eyes and terrible
            body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensnarers</strong> are the result of
            pitlings getting ahold of an unfortunate soul. The
            pitling is in the process of digesting the soul of a
            creature, physically boring through its head, and
            flopping around like an appendage. The body is
            puppeteered and mid transformation into a demon, with
            mouths forming on the creature's hands and arms that
            shoot out long, barbed tongues as attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Frenzied</strong> are similar to ensnarers,
            but their transformation into a true demon is more
            advanced, resulting in a fast and viscous creature full
            of energy and hunger for more souls.</li>

          <h4>CATEGORY 2 DEMONS</h4>
          <p>The following category 2 demons are included in this
          book:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rumored to be the initial source of the teachings
            of all shadows through the College of Black Ash,
            <strong>remasches</strong> are demons whose physical
            form is blended with the nature of the wastes where
            they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield,
            inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through
            the minions they control.</li>
            <li>Possessed of glowing eyes and tendril-ringed maws,
            <strong>ruinants</strong> breathe with a sickening
            wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. A
            ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their
            victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon's own
            body.</li>
            <li><strong>Torlases</strong> are piecemeal
            abominations whose physical forms don't obey the normal
            laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using
            living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into
            advantageous position.</li>
            <li><strong>Bendraks</strong> appear as an amalgamation
            of flesh and shards of a broken mirror, able to shape
            their bodies to distract and confuse their foes. A
            bendrak can divert an enemy's attack to another enemy
            or hide themselves or allies behind dazzling
            reflections.</li>
            <li><strong>Mucerons</strong> are the result of an
            ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to
            become a brutish creature, covered in several mouths
            that shoot out barbed tongues, pulling an enemy's
            attention along with pulling them physically.</li>
            <li><strong>Chorogaunts</strong> are terrifying demon
            leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon
            bodies formed into a mobile, living musical instrument.
            Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in
            the demon's chest and its ribs are upturned into a
            fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse
            enemies, making them more vulnerable to other
            demons.</li>

        <p>At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend VP to
        activate one of the following features.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Soulburn (3 VP):</strong> Every demon acting
            this turn deals additional damage equal to their level
            with their abilities and free strikes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Abyssal Rift (5 VP):</strong> Two size 2
            rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of
            your choosing. Each demon within 5 squares of a rift
            gains an edge on attacks. Any demon can use an abyssal
            rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the
            encounter, moving into any space in one rift and
            appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the
            other rift. Any non-demon creature who enters the rift
            for the first time in a round or starts their turn
            there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the
            highest-level demon within 20 squares of a rift. An
            abyssal rift is an immovable object that has Stamina
            25, weapon immunity 5, and holy weakness 5. As a
            maneuver, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics
            skill can make a hard Reason or Intuition test while
            adjacent to a rift to destabilize it. On a success, the
            rift closes. On a failure with a consequence, the rift
            regains 5 Stamina. If no demons are within 20 squares
            of the rift, it closes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Abyssal Evolution (7 VP):</strong> A demon
            minion of your choice turns into a non-minion demon of
            the same level.</p>

      <h2>GOBLINS</h2>
      <p>As with all humanoid ancestries, different types of
      goblins and goblin cultures can be found across many lands,
      each with their own ideals. Known among themselves as
      <strong>rogabrin</strong>, meaning “more of us” in their
      language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in
      the world. They can be found in every environment humans
      occupy and in places many other humanoids avoid, including
      deep cave systems.</p>
      <p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins
      particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing,
      and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in
      subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and
      chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit
      neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins
      who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of
      their society—thieves and murderers shunned by their own
      people.</p>
      <section id="encountered-in-groups" class="level3">
        <h3>ENCOUNTERED IN GROUPS</h3>
        <p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins
        survive and thrive because they work together. A single
        goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw
        goblins are supremely confident—perhaps overly so. Such
        groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing
        through their territory, be it desert, forest, or
        underground. Larger bands might become unscrupulous
        mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how
        they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an
        overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber
        friends.</p>

        <h3>MOBILE AND SNEAKY</h3>
        <p>Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for
        mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in
        untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural
        agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These
        crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking
        at their enemies' knees, or unleash arrows as they dart
        from tree to tree.</p>

      <section id="goblin-magic" class="level3">
        <h3>GOBLIN MAGIC</h3>
        <p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for
        magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends.
        Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of
        their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes
        that keep their enemies at bay.</p>

        <p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a
        skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making
        them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these
        pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete
        a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>

        With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a
        swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a
        platform on the beast's back. During a raid, a spider

      <h2>HUMANS</h2>
      <p>Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from
      inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain.
      While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some
      are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for
      excitement or power.</p>

        <h3>VILLAINS AND HEROES</h3>
        <p>Recognizing their limited lifespan, humans often set
        their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip
        of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and
        even aspire to godhood, all in hopes their names will be
        remembered forever. Violence and greed are close cousins in
        the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive
        for more by the sword. Others turn to theft, often driven
        to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human
        lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons—both exact
        a toll. Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning
        their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed
        circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to
        call on. Cultists seek dark desires in exchange for
        service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting
        apocalypse. Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to
        righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better.
        Heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again,
        standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit
        of justice.</p>

        <h3>RISKS AND REWARDS</h3>
        <p>Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as
        to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive training
        explains their renowned knack for seizing the
        moment—knowing when to risk it all on a throw of the dice.
        Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their
        opponent's mistakes and seize the advantage. Humans see
        unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an
        untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village or an
        ancient dungeon yielding a chest full of coins. Pursuing
        such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these
        gamblers, it's a game worth playing.</p>

      <h2>RADENWIGHTS</h2>
      <p>Small, agile, and hardy, radenwights have the appearance
      of humanoid rodents. They're often referred to as “ratfolk,”
      a name they don't particularly mind but also don't embrace.
      Should anyone ask, many radenwights speak of being a ratfolk
      when they're alone, but always a radenwight when part of a
      group. Radenwight groups proudly call themselves a “meddle,”
      and have a knack for appearing where others hoped they
      wouldn't or whenever they are least expected. Radenwight
      meddles can be found in the wilderness as easily as in any
      city, so long as there's suitable work and excitement to keep
      the members of the meddle occupied.</p>
      <p>If radenwights' enemies expect them to scurry away like
      rats, they will be painfully surprised to see the combined
      arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them
      all at once. Whatever radenwights do, they do it fearlessly,
      with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining
      through in even the most rakish and roguish of them.
      Radenwights aren't above banditry if it will support the
      meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and
      knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly
      violence. They prefer weapons of precision, and look for
      opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create
      openings for one another.</p>
      <section id="bonds-and-bravado" class="level3">
        <h3>BONDS AND BRAVADO</h3>
        <p>It's a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk,
        and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by
        running away or climbing to safety only gets you so far.
        Radenwights learn boldness from birth and are taught to
        hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that
        stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense
        bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their
        comrades, and their community, and the knowledge that every
        other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In
        a scrap, it's not one radenwight's blade or arrow that
        brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual
        follow-up from their fellows.</p>

        <h3>THE MAGIC OF MUSIC</h3>
        <p>The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among
        radenwights, though the community throws their support
        behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat
        more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical
        aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight
        meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance.
        Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes,
        inspired by the legend of a flutist who enraptured an evil
        dragon while her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder
        to be dropped from the cliff above.</p>

        <h3>RADENWIGHT VILLAIN POWER</h3>
        <p>At the start of any radenwight's turn, you can spend VP
        to activate one of the following features.</p>
        <p><strong>Trouser Cut (3 VP)</strong> A non-minion
        radenwight can use the following ability.</p>
        <p><strong>Trouser Cut (Action)</strong> ◆ 2d10 + 2
        Keywords: Attack, Melee, Weapon Distance: Reach 1 Target:
        One creature</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✦ ≤11: 5 damage; push 3</li>
          <li>★ 12–16: 10 damage; push 3; taunted (EoT)</li>
          <li>✸ 17+: 12 damage; push 3; taunted (REA ends) Effect:
          If a target is wearing clothing covering the lower half
          of their body, they must use a maneuver to pull that
          clothing up before they can move.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Rat Race (5 VP)</strong> Each radenwight shifts
        up to their speed. Wherever a radenwight ends this movement
        adjacent to at least one other radenwight, they can make a
        melee free strike against a target.</p>
        <p><strong>Wall of Rats (7 VP)</strong> A 10-foot wall of
        living rats scurrying atop one another in a coordinated
        manner appears in unoccupied spaces anywhere on the
        encounter map and lasts until the end of the encounter. The
        wall doesn't block line of effect for radenwights and their
        allies, but it does for other creatures, as the rats
        coordinate their movements with the radenwights. Each
        square of the wall has 10 Stamina. If the last radenwight
        in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the
        rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy
        on the encounter map must then make an Intuition resistance
        roll.</p>

      <h2>TIME RAIDERS</h2>
      <p>The kuran'zoi (coor-AN-zoy), also called time raiders, are
      humanoids who make the astral realm of the Sea of Stars their
      home. Many kuran'zoi make their living as guides for
      travelers from other planes, while others survive on the Sea
      of Stars through piracy against interplanar vessels.</p>
      <section id="veterans-of-the-psychic-wars" class="level3">
        <h3>VETERANS OF THE PSYCHIC WARS</h3>
        <p>Thousands of years ago, the synlirii—a powerful species
        of evil psionic aberrations—created the kuran'zoi as
        soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and
        enhanced these warriors' psionic potential, the kuran'zoi
        came to understand the true nature of their progenitors.
        They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of
        Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="hardened-vision-hexapods" class="level3">
        <h3>HARDENED-VISION HEXAPODS</h3>
        <p>Kuran'zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow
        them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also
        defend them against the hardlight storms of the astral
        realm, the escaping kuran'zoi chose the Sea of Stars as
        their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar. Time
        raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield
        melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single
        well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="psi-tech" class="level3">
        <h3>PSI-TECH</h3>
        <p>Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on
        mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only
        their people can activate. Many kuran'zoi specialize in
        melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time
        raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of
        psionic armor that empower their allies.</p>

      <section id="genre-raiders" class="level3">
        <h3>GENRE RAIDERS</h3>
        <p>The moniker “time raider” is imprecise. Rather, when
        kuran'zoi raid a world of the timescape that relies on
        sorcery instead of kuran'zoi technology—including Orden—it
        seems to those worlds' people as though the time raiders
        have come from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of
        light that hit as hard as steel.</p>

        <h3>LEAVE A FEW ALIVE</h3>
        <p>Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but
        allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can
        make it back home. Kuran'zoi pirate captains often remind
        their crews: “Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they'll
        return with a new coat of wool for us to shear.”</p>

        <h3>CREATURES OUTSIDE TIME</h3>
        <p>While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other
        creatures don't age. As a result, many living kuran'zoi
        recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned
        from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new
        battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch
        attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they
        want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond
        war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and
        similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their
        creches secret and protected.</p>

        <h3>TIME RAIDER VILLAIN POWER</h3>
        <p>At the start of any time raider's turn, you can spend VP
        to activate one of the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gravity Well (3 VP):</strong> A time raider
          acting this turn can activate gravity well on a square
          they move through while using a move action. The gravity
          well lasts until the end of the encounter or until a
          creature who can reach the well uses a maneuver to
          disable it. Each square within 4 squares of the gravity
          well is difficult terrain for non-time raiders, and any
          non-time raider who ends their turn in such a square is
          pulled 4 squares toward the well.</li>
          <li><strong>Recall Module (5 VP):</strong> Until the end
          of the round, whenever a time raider ends their turn with
          movement remaining, they can teleport back to the space
          where they started their turn (or the closest unoccupied
          space of their choice), and make a free strike as a free
          triggered action.</li>
          <li><strong>Psi-Cage (7 VP):</strong> All time raiders in
          the encounter create a psionic field over the encounter
          map, which lasts until the time raider with the highest
          Stamina maximum drops to Stamina 0 or chooses to end the
          field. While the field is up, each non-time raider on the
          map must make a Reason resistance roll against this
          psionic effect at the start of each round. ✸ ≤11: 8

        CONTENT WARNING: BRAINWASHING AND BODY HORROR</h3>
        <p>War dogs are explicitly evil soldiers built from the
        body parts of various humans. They are created brainwashed
        and indoctrinated to carry out the vile orders of Ajax, a
        tyrant who wants to rule the world. Check in with your
        players before running war dogs to make sure that they're
        okay with battling these brainwashed soldiers with an
        appearance akin to Frankenstein's monster if he were built
        to be a shock troop. If anyone is uncomfortable, modify the
        appearance and lore of the war dogs as you see fit.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ajax's War Dogs—brutal patchwork soldiers—owe their new
      lives to the Iron Saint, and fight for him fanatically. War
      Dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal
      patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable.
