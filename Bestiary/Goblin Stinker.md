**Effect:** The area is filled with a green haze until the start of the stinker's next turn or until the stinker is reduced to Stamina 0. The area is [[Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]] for non-goblin creatures, and each such creature who moves within the area takes 2 poison damage for each square moved. The haze can't be dispersed by wind.

**Crafty**

The stinker doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving.
